💻 Installation Guide & Tips

Installation Guide:

1. Install Prism Launcher (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, It's faster, better, and has a ton of QoL features)
2. In Prism Launcher, click Add Instance ➞ Modrinth ➞ Type "ALAND" in the Search ➞ Click the Modpack ➞ Click OK

TIP 1: For Prism users, make sure you select the correct Java version and dedicate at least 4GB of RAM. If you
also plan on using the Hypixel+ resource pack then put this inside the JVM arguments field: -Xss4M

TIP 2: After joining the game, type /firmament macros or tap the "Delete" key on your keyboard to open the
command macros/keybinds. These run commands for Hypixel SkyBlock such as warps and menus for quick access
and you can edit them if you want.

TIP 3: Don't like a certain mod/feature/resource pack? Just delete/configure it however you like!

❓ FAQ

Why did the modpack crash/fail to load?

* Make sure you select the correct Java version and dedicate at least 4GB of RAM.

Why is my FPS stuck at 60?

* VSync is turned on to prevent screen tear artefacts and reduce resource usage, ensuring a smooth experience.
  You can disable it in the general Video Settings and by configuring the Dynamic FPS mod to turn it off everywhere.

I'm still having FPS issues! How to fix?

* If you play on a potato, try disabling all resource packs, deleting the Roughly Enough Items and REI Search Bar
  Calculations mod, and further lowering your graphical settings. P.S. Lag during game startup is to be expected,
  just give it a minute or two to load everything.

I don't use Prism Launcher, how do I load the modpack?

* Install Prism Launcher, it's lightweight, super fast, and allows you to download mods/resource packs with ease.
  It's the best option for modern Minecraft.

Can I transfer my own config files for x mod?

* Yes, you can just delete the config file of any mod in the modpack's "config" folder and replace it with your own.
  This way, you can transfer your own SkyHanni/Skyblocker/other settings over.

Why did I randomly warp/trigger a command by tapping a random key?

* These are known as command macros/keybinds. Type /firmament macros or tap the "Delete" key to open the config menu.
  You can assign any key and make it run any command you want to make warping/accessing menus easier!
